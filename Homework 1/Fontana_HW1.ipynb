Note, interest rates will impact the saver, as you should assume they put the money they are saving towards a house purchase into a safe liquid investment that earns interest. For example, 10 year US treasuries. For simplicity, you may assume that this interest rate is the same as the rate `r` on mortgages. In reality it is lower, but they are strongly correlated.\n\n#### Renter profile\nThe *renter* profile insists on buying a house with as little cash as possible. For example, they may be attempting *interest rate arbitrage*, where one invests whatever cash they have in investments which they hope will have a higher rate of return over the liftime of the home loan than the interest rate `rate` on the home loan. Or, they simply may not have the cash to spend. \nTypically, to avoid additional fees, it is necessary to make a down payment of 20% of the purchase price of the home, while the minimum down payment allowed is 5%. The loan term is most often 30 years, meaning the amount borrowed is paid back in full over 30 years, although 15 and 10 are also used by some buyers to minimize the amount paid in interest. Since the renter profile is taking borrowing to the extremes, we will assume they use a 30 year loan term.\n\nFor simplicity, we will assume in the calculations we make below that the renter profile puts 0% down towards the purchase price and borrows the purchase price at the interest rate `rate`.\n","metadata":{"id":"T8t8oL-cPU6M","cell_id":"00047-7a5cfada-31a7-4440-95de-5a65b4931c80","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n#### Example calculations\nLet's look at two examples to get you started on the exercise.\n\n#### Example 1\nLet's start by calculating the price the *saver profile* can afford to pay for a house if they save for 10 years.

Calculate what how many years the saver profile needs to save to be able to buy a house which is priced at the [median price for homes in Atlanta](https://www.zillow.com/atlanta-ga/home-values/).\n3. What if the interest rate is 2% instead of 3%, or 3% instead of 2%? What if it is 10% as it was in the 1980's? Repeat the calculation in the previous question with these new interest rates. \n4. Suppose that a house is currently on the market with an asking price of \\$725000 when the interest rate is 3%. Calculate how large `house_spend` would need to be for the renter profile buyer to be able to purchase this house.\n5. Suppose interest rates suddenly climb from 3 up to 4%.
