See that notebook for the dataset and template code.\n*  Generate a violin plot that shows the distribution of height in each income group. Can you see a relationship between these variables?\n* Make a boxplot that shows the distribution of weight in each income group. Plot the y-axis on a logarithmic scale.\n* Generate a visualization of the relationship between weight and vegetable consumption. ",

If the relationship is nonlinear, correlation generally underestimates how strong it is.\n\nTo demonstrate, generate another example of fake data that is different from the data presented in the text which was $y=x^2$. Explain what is the association between the variables (e.g. $y=x^4$, $y=sin(x)$) and why the correlation is low or zero despite there being a clear relationship between the variables.",

Explain which ML APIs you were interested in, which you tried but couldn't use, and potential use cases that you would like to explore as well as data sources you would like to apply them to.\n\nFinally, because we can't run Sagemaker code in a colab notebook, convert your walkthrough notebook from this exercise into a .html file using `jupyter nbconvert` as the command line. Then, create an S3 bucket, upload the .html file to your bucket, and follow the instructions [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/HowDoIWebsiteConfiguration.html) for making the .html available as a webpage.\n\n Share the link to it in this notebook, so that I and other students can read your walkthrough.",
